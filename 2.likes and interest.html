    <li> people : what kind of people do i like? everything is about loyalty. i like sincere and decent people whom i can trust. no lies. i always try to be that kind of person as well.</li>
    <li> music : i love hiphop/r&b with meaningful lyrics. sick of bitch, ho, pussy, and fuck. hiphop is not about being sexist. so normally i prefer to listen to edm which is much more intuitive and simple. i am so crazy in tropical house in summer. i love k-pop as well but not like idol musics... i love iu and baekyerin.
    <li> etc : i like unexpected kindness. i like to drink tea in my empty classroom after students went home. i like spring breeze with cheery blossoms that makes me lonely and weird. i like the moment when i get out of the exit in the airport arrivals. i like cold kimchi rice with warm korean tea. i like to go to sleep without even noticing. i like when i make a person or people laugh. i like when my family try hard to bond with each other so it looks happy. i like when i concentrate on sth and am very good at it. i like when people think i am awesome.

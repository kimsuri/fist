  <h1>삶의 관점 perspective of life</h1>
  <h2>어떻게 살아야 하는가? how to live?</h2>
  <h4>this is the hard part. to be honest, i don't really think about the way to live a life. i just do live so days goes by. <br> what i like about my life is that i care less about anything. sometimes i call it lazy. even when i am low and jealous i just don't care. because i know it's like a moment. i am very good at to forget and just relax. cba to write more.</h4>
